Weekdays, especially from Tuesday to Thursday, have the highest number of flights, all above 100,000. Starting Friday, flight volume begins to drop, and the decline continues into the weekend. Saturday has the fewest flights by a large margin, suggesting that airlines schedule significantly fewer departures on weekends.

The delays vary widely, driven not only by the airline itself but by airport-specific conditions.
